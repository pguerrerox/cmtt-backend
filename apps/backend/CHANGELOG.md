## [0.6.1] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- Added one-shot operations import worker commands (`worker:operations-import` in backend and `operations:import` at monorepo root) to populate `operations_planned_dates` from the Excel source.
- Added manager role allowlist helper and repository validation for manager create/update flows.
- Added tests for operations import worker behavior and manager role validation paths.

### Changed
- Updated manager schema to constrain `role` values to `Team Leader`, `Senior Project Manager`, `Project Manager`, and `Guest`.
- Improved operations date normalization to parse slash-formatted Excel date strings (for example `MM/DD/YYYY`) into integer timestamps.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- Added configurable CORS origin allowlist support via `CORS_ORIGINS`.

- Updated backend README environment variable documentation with `CORS_ORIGINS` usage.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- Added comprehensive JSDoc coverage across backend entrypoints, routes, repositories, workers, DB bootstrap/schema modules, and helpers to standardize in-code API contracts.
- Added monorepo baseline docs for architecture and API usage (`docs/architecture.md`, `docs/api.md`) and backend/frontend workspace onboarding.

### Changed
- Migrated repository layout to a monorepo structure with backend code under `apps/backend` and workspace scripts at the repo root.
- Updated backend and root READMEs with workspace commands, worker execution guidance, and versioning policy notes.
- Updated API documentation to include manager read-only (non-admin) routes.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- Added one-shot lookup-queue worker (`npm run worker:projects-lookup`) to enrich projects from operations planned dates.
- Added worker configuration env vars: `LOOKUP_BATCH_SIZE`, `LOOKUP_RETRY_DELAY_MS`, `LOOKUP_MAX_ATTEMPTS`.
- Added worker tests covering enrich, retry, and max-attempt failure behavior.

### Changed
- Extended lookup queue repository with worker support helpers: `getDueQueueItems`, `updateQueueEntry`, `removeFromQueue`.
- Expanded lookup queue repository tests for due selection, updates, and dequeue flows.
- Updated README with worker usage, scheduling guidance, and configuration.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- Added operations planned dates schema and repository:
  - `db/schema/operations.schema.js`
  - `repositories/operations.repo.js` (`upsert`, `getOperationsPlanByProjectNumber`)
- Added project lookup queue schema and repository:
  - `db/schema/projectsLookup.schema.js`
  - `repositories/projectsLookup.repo.js` (`enqueueProject`, `getProjectByNumber`, `getAllQueue`)

### Changed

- Wired `createProject` to:
  - enrich projects from `operations_planned_dates` when found

- Updated `POST /createProject` response to include `lookup_status` (`enriched` or `queued`).
- Normalized date/timestamp write paths in operations/queue repositories to store integer values.
- Expanded project repository/route tests to cover enriched and queued create-project flows.
